    <h2>Decription:</h2>
    <p>
      This lemon snack cake has it all—in one sweet and sour slice! The
      foundation is a moist, super-soft lemon cake. (The flavor gets a boost by
      rubbing the lemon zest into the sugar before mixing into the batter, as
      the granules help to extract those glorious natural oils from the zest.) A
      just-sweet-enough cream cheese frosting uses a small amount of heavy cream
      to add thickness and stability while maintaining a dreamy texture.
      Finally, each cake is doused in a simple lemon glaze for a last zing of
      juicy flavor.
    </p>

      <strong>Cook's Note:</strong><br />
      For the prettiest effect, use a spatula to create a back-and-forth zigzag
      effect on the surface of the filling. Don’t worry about making it perfect
      or even; those ridges on the surface will create an almost rippled look
      after slicing. Try tinting the glaze with a little yellow food coloring to
      enhance its natural color, too!

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cups flour</li>

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

      <li>3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>

      <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest (from 1 lemon), plus more for garnish</li>

      <li>16 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>

      <li>2 eggs, at room temperature</li>

      <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>

      <li>10 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 3 large lemons)</li>

      <li>6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>

      <li>3 3/4 cups powdered sugar</li>

      <li>1/3 cup whipping cream</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Line
        bottom of pan with parchment paper and coat parchment with cooking
        spray.
      </li>

      <li>
        Whisk together flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium
        bowl. In another medium bowl, rub white sugar and lemon zest together
        with your hands until well combined (sugar will start to turn yellow).
      </li>

      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat 10
        tablespoons butter and the lemon zest mixture at medium speed until
        light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing at
        medium speed and scraping bowl well after each addition.
      </li>

      <li>
        Mix in about one-third of flour mixture at low speed. Mix in 1/3 cup
        sour cream. Scrape bowl well. Mix in another one-third of flour mixture,
        then mix in 3 tablespoons lemon juice and remaining 1/3 cup sour cream.
        Scrape bowl well. Mix in remaining one-third of flour mixture until
        incorporated and batter is smooth.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pour batter into prepared pan and spread in an even layer. Bake until
        cake springs back lightly when touched in center, 25 to 30 minutes.
        Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.
      </li>

      <li>
        For frosting, put cream cheese and remaining 6 tablespoons butter in the
        bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (bowl should be
        clean and dry). Beat at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes.
        Gradually mix in 3/4 cup powdered sugar at medium speed until
        incorporated.
      </li>

      <li>
        With mixer running at medium speed, add whipping cream, 2 tablespoons
        lemon juice, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt until fully incorporated.
      </li>

      <li>
        When cake is cool, run a small offset spatula around outside edge and
        invert onto a cutting board. Spread frosting evenly over top of cake.
        Loosely cover cake with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 1 to 2
        hours.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a long sharp knife to cut cake into 12 even rectangles. Line a
        baking sheet with parchment paper; put a wire rack on baking sheet and
        arrange cake pieces on rack.
      </li>

      <li>
        For glaze, whisk together milk, vanilla, and remaining 3 cups powdered
        sugar and 5 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium bowl until a drizzly
        glaze forms.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spoon glaze evenly over cake pieces, using offset spatula to spread
        evenly and allowing excess to drip off sides.
      </li>

      <li>
        Gently slide offset spatula under each cake piece to transfer to an
        airtight storage container. Chill until ready to serve (or up to 4
        days).
      </li>
    </ol>
